# Flower

## Introduction 
Flower is a streamlit application for a specific client that is in need of an Machine learning model that can see patterns between healthy cherry leafs and powdery mildew infected leafs. With Flower our client will be able to examinate cherry leafs and understand the infection better wich will help us to understand the world we live in. 

## Project descirption 
Flower is a streamlit app that is empowerd by ML 

## User demographic 
* Flower is created for a specific client that is intrested in conducting a study ti visually differentiate a cherry leaf that is healthy from one that contains powdery mildew
* The client is also intrested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew. 

## Functions 

The project has a machine learning model suited for the clients need. 

### We have 4 diffrent apps inside our streamlit application 
* Qucik project Summery- On this Page we describe the project where we talk about general information about the fungal disease "Powdery mildew". We also explain where we got the sampels for the machine to learn from. 
* Leaf Detector - In leaf detector the client is able to drop a PNG file that will be scanned by the machine and try to figure out if the leaf is infected with mildew or not. The Client will also get a graph.
* Project Hypothesis - In "Project Hypothesis" the client will be able to read our hypothesis and validation about the project. We also added pictures from the Jupyter notebook we got back where the machine found the avg image for healthy and infected leafs with an explanation in the end. 
* ML Performance Metrics - On this side the client will be able to see how the machine learned and the preformence. We also added the graph of how we devided all pictures from the dataset for "training, validation and test". 
In the end you will also see the Generalised Performance test where we have an accuracy of 0.9929% wich is something we are very proud of and can stand behind.
